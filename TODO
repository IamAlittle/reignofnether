Bugfixes
--------

[✔] /rts-reset now works from command blocks

[✔] Spiders can no longer spawn out of lairs as vanilla jockeys and crash the game

[✔] Liquid blocks that are part of a building can now be destroyed on damage.
    This means Flame Sanctuaries are no longer indestructible and damaged wheat/pumpkin farms can dry up.

[✔] Fixed crash related to deselecting and reselecting control groups

[✔] Fixed crash when selecting a nametagged unit

[✔] Enabling F12 cam now forces you out of 3rd person cam so that you don't get rendering issues

[❌] Iron golems attack friendly units on attack move


[❌] On a server match, population appears to be incorrect a lot
    - Server mismatches client
    - Spectators see different to client
    - Unupgraded portals are somehow worth 10 supply




[❌] [#29] Resources go negative after a match is done
    - make sure we're removing players' resources on each end condition, including:
        - defeat()
        - resetRTS()

[❌] [performance] joining a loaded server causes huge lag

[❌] Logic for breaking trees also breaks all wooden buildings that aren't supported


Balancing
---------
[❌] Allow garrisoned units to be shot at, but at 1/2 damage
    - have half of projectiles blocked by the battlements
    - if STILL too powerful, cause all explosive damage to directly hit garrisoned units too at 1/4 damage




Quality of Life Features
------------------------
[❌] Banners and coloured minimap indicators for each player (each new player to join gets the next colour in order)\
        - place banners after building completion
        - use coloured
        - reserve yellow for neutral

[❌] Radius indicator around monster capitol and stronghold to better indicate range of night
    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)

[❌] More shift click queue commands
    - Build already-placed foundations
    - Repair damaged buildings
    - Move units

[❌] Hovering buttons (or some other indicator) for idle farms
    - Clicking said button will assign the nearest idle villager to it





TODO BACKLOG

Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
- beehives are not gatherable
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
